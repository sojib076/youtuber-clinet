                    Difference between SQL and NoSQL?
                </div>
                <div className="collapse-content">
                    <p>                   Difference between SQL and NoSQL is that SQL is a relational database and NoSQL is a non-relational database. SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. This means that SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data whereas NoSQL databases are the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions. SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.</p>

                    <p>     JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA.</p>

                How does NodeJS handle multiple requests at the same time?

                <div className="collapse-content">
                    <p>     Node.js is a single-threaded application, but it can support concurrency via the concept of event and callbacks. Every API of Node.js is asynchronous and being single-threaded, they use async function calls to maintain concurrency. Node uses observer pattern. Node thread keeps an event loop and whenever a task gets completed, it fires the corresponding event which signals the event-listener function to execute.</p>
